## About
This is the source code for **Shredderun**, a game I created for **Code for a Cause** in 5 days. Naturally, the time constraints means this code is extremely messy, unorganized, unoptimized, etc etc. This repository is more so you can investigate and copy anything you find interesting.

I may eventually return to this project and implement the things I didn't have time for or update the code, but for now, I need a break. I will not be fixing bugs or solving issues relating to this project.

Also note that this code was uploaded after I edited some prefabs and other assets to make the graphical art on the itch page, so some things may be different or broken if you try to compile the code.
